                text: `The goal of my PhD thesis project was to develop synthetic genetic circuitry for controlling asymmetric cell division and cell differentiation in E. coli. My discoveries led to a prominent publication in Nature Chemical Biology1, 2, 3, a new patent-pending invention called Microbial Stem Cell Technology (MiST)4, and the founding of a small business, called AsimicA LLC, whose goal is to apply that technology in bringing transformational change across multiple biomanufacturing industries. In the first years of my thesis project, I designed, carried out, and interpreted biological experiments, formed productive collaboration with other scientists, presented my research at multiple scientific conferences, and trained new students in laboratory practices. Over the past two years, I have maintained these activities and at the same time worked towards establishing myself as an upcoming biotech entrepreneur. To this end, I have obtained patent protection for MiST, my intellectual property, I have incorporated a small business for which I am lead scientist and chief officer, I have obtained some seed funding to start that business, and I have put special effort into making connections that will help my small business develop and grow. These connections include mentors and advisors at the Wyoming Technology Business Center (WTBC), Wyoming Small Business Development Center (SBDC), and a number of contacts in academic fermentation science, synthetic biology, and bioproduction industries. Last year I competed in the “Fisher Innovation Challenge”, a competition between small business student teams in Wyoming, and reached the level of finalist. I also won competitive funding for AsmicA through the Wyoming SBIR/STTR Initiative, which provided an SBIR Phase 0-00 grant to support travel, technical training, and business development networking. I look forward to following my entrepreneurial goals with future small business funding, with the mid-term goal of commercializing AsimicA technology and expertise by forming partnerships with large biomanufacturing companies.

In addition to mentoring Nikolai, I have graduated two other PhD students since founding the lab in 2012 and I am in the process of training three others. Together, these experiences have provided me with expertise in project management, which I will apply in guiding AsimicA towards achieving its scientific goals.
            AsimicA, is founded on a core set of genetic technology that allows us to establish and control asymmetric cell division and cell differentiation in bacterial cells. This technology is protected by a provisional patent and can expect further protection from a non-provisional patent that is currently under review at the United States Patent Office. Thanks to patent protection, AsimicA is the only entity that can legally pursue this approach towards increasing bioreactor yields, making our company the sole choice for embarking this scientific and commercial endeavor.
            More importantly, NikolaI Mushnikov and I are the primary inventors of AsimicA technology. Because we have extensive hands-on technical experience with our invention, we are better suited to the task of making it a scientific success than anybody else.

                The outcome of this project is the genetic technology underlying MiST and the associated patent application and the related scientific publication in Nature Chemical Biology. The project was conceived by Nikolai Mushnikov and me, and nearly all experiments were performed by N. Mushnikov. Our starting point was normal E. coli cells, which divide symmetrically into two indistinguishable daughter cells. The goals were to import a set of biological components that establish cell polarity and asymmetric cell division, and to connect the asymmetrically distributed components to differential patterns of gene expression in the two daughter cell types. In achieving this, we created a genetic mechanism for establishing and controlling cell differentiation in E. coli. An important quality of our mechanism for establishing cell polarity, which is based on PopZ, is that it forms a polar complex that is stable over multiple generations. Thus, PopZ positive cell types, once established, will retain their identity over many generations. This is the basis of the “stem cell” phenotype in MiST (Microbial Stem cell Technology).

                PopZ and cell pole organization in bacteria
                During my postdoc I discovered and characterized the polar organizing protein PopZ, which is a key biological component of MiST (see contribution #1). I was first author on the first report of PopZ in 2008, which was published as one of two back-to-back papers on the subject (the other was from the laboratory of Christine Jacobs-Wagner at Yale University). Since that time, I have devoted a substantial amount of research effort towards understanding the structure and function of this important and fascinating protein. This has led to publications that have broad significance to the field of bacterial cell biology. Beyond gaining a more complete understanding of bacterial cell organization, the work has brought influential new concepts into the field, such as the role of intrinsically disordered hub proteins in organizing bacterial structures at cell poles, and the three-dimensional nature of these complex sub-cellular microdomains.

                Mechanisms of bacterial chromosome Segregation.
                As a multifunctional polar organizing protein, one of PopZ’s principle duties is to guide the process of chromosome segregation during cell division. This is evident in the strong phenotype of ΔpopZ knockout strains, which are defective in DNA partitioning and have consequential defects in cell division and viability. We have observed these effects in two different Alphaproteobacterial species, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Caulobacter crescentus, and we have also addressed the connections between PopZ and the chromosome segregation machinery at the molecular level. Interestingly, PopZ’s hub functionality allows it to bind to the protein that marks the centromere and also the ATPase that drives segregation, possibly establishing
                mutually reinforcing directional cues. Our most recent publication uncovered a novel C. crescentus protein that blocks the assembly of polar PopZ foci at the destination pole just prior to the time of chromosome segregation. Thus, we are moving towards a more complete understanding of how PopZ becomes localized to the cell poles, gaining knowledge that may be useful in improving MiST.

                Secretory granule assembly in a Eukaryotic organism.
                My PhD thesis project focused on the regulated secretory pathway, which is the transport and secretion mechanism for insulin in pancreatic islet cells. The research questions focused on the assembly of secretory proteins into paracrystalline superstructures called dense-core granules. In the model system that I studied, correctly assembled structures function like a loaded spring, which undergoes extremely rapid expansion following exocytosis and exposure to extracellular calcium. These fascinating structures are the foundation of my career-long interest in complex protein assemblies.
